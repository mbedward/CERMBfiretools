# CERMBfiretools

An R package to perform a small subset of the vegetation and fire interval threshold analyses implemented in the larger
[FireToolsR](https://github.com/ozjimbob/FireTools2R) package, written by Grant Williamson. The
FireToolsR package is designed for use by land management agencies in a cloud-based services, and standardizes 
the types and formats of input data and spatial layers. In constrast, this package leaves
pre-processing and data extraction to the user, with the aim of making it easier to include in a variety
of analytical frameworks. Core processing is done using [RcppArmadillo](https://github.com/RcppCore/RcppArmadillo)
to reduce run times.

The code has been written for use by the Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires, 
University of Wollongong, Australia.
